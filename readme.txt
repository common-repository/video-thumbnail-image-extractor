A way to embedd video image thumbnail on the post.

== Description ==

Sometimes we need to show the different images of a video on our post instead embedding the whole video. To give a video snippet it is a quick way to embed web video thumbnails on your post (youtube and vimeo only this time). More video sites support will be added soon.

How does this plugin work ?

You need to put some keywords with your video URL as below:

images_link						: Fetches image thumbnails
images_withlink_link	: Fetches image thumbnails with a hyperlink to original video

e.g. images_http://youtube.com/watch?v=xxxxxx

e.g. images_http://vimeo.com/xxxxxx

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.
